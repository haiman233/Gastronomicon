### Define custom food in this file
#
# Format:
# FOOD_ID
#   - name: str
#   - (OPTIONAL) lore: [list: str]
#   - hunger: int
#   - saturation-ratio: double (OR) - saturation: int
#   - material: MATERIAL (OR) - texture: TEXTURE
#   - effects:
#     - EFFECT_TYPE: [parameters]
#   - recipe: {...}
#
# Where,
#   FOOD_ID is any string in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, and must not already be in use.
#     Gastronomicon will append `GN_` to the beginning when registering the item.
#   MATERIAL is a valid Material name,
#   TEXTURE is a valid base64 texture string
#     (see https://bukkit.org/threads/create-your-own-custom-head-texture.424286/),
#   and EFFECT_TYPE is one of the ids described below.
# The recipe format will be specified after.
#
# Note that `saturation-ratio` and `saturation` are mutually exclusive and so are
#   `material` and `texture`.
#
# Effect types:
#   heal [amount: int]: Heal [amount] HP. (amount > 0)
#   positive-potion-effect [type: POTION_EFFECT_TYPE] [int seconds] [int amplifier]:

# It is not possible to define custom effects types in this file; in order to
# create food with custom effects, you must add it in a plugin.
# See https://github.com/SchnTgaiSpock/Gastronomicon/wiki/CustomFood on how to do so.
